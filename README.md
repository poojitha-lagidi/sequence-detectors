# Sequence Detectors
A sequence detector is a sequential circuit designed to recognize a specific pattern of bits within a stream of input bits. It generates an output of 1 when the desired pattern is detected; otherwise, the output remains _0_. Sequence detectors are commonly used in digital systems for tasks such as error detection, synchronization, and data recognition. They can be implemented using various types of finite state machines (FSMs), such as Mealy or Moore machines
